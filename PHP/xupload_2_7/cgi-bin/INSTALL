XUpload script installation (version 2.7)

1) Copy all files except "upload_form.html" to your cgi-bin folder (or folder where perl scripts running)
   Copy "upload_form.html" into your htdocs folder.

2) Create 2 new folders in cgi-bin for temp files and for finished uploads. 
   CHMOD them to 777.
   .cgi files should be CHMODed to 755
   cgi-bin folder should be CHMODed 755 too

3) Modify XUploadConfig.pm file with your server details.

4) Edit upload_form.html: change form action URL to your scripts folder URL.

That's all! Now you can go to www.yoursite.com/.../upload_form.html and start 
uploading files with XUpload.


Good luck!
